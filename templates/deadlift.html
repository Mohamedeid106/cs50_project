            <h1>What is Dead Lift?</h1>

            <p>
                The deadlift is a great way to build strong legs and butt.
                 In a deadlift, you lift weight from the ground to thigh level using primarily your leg and hip muscles,
                  but with the assistance of most of the large muscle groups of your body.
                   The deadlift is usually performed with a bar and plates or a fixed barbell, but you can do it with dumbbells.
                    It is a specialty of powerlifters that you shouldn't ignore in general fitness training.
                     Make deadlifts part of your strength-training workouts to build muscle and functional fitness.

            <h1>How to Perform a Deadlift:</h1>

            <img src="../static/deadlift.jpg" alt="Dead Lift">

            <p>
                Select a lightweight barbell or two dumbbells.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Step 1</strong>: Grasp the bar just outside the line of your knees with an overhand or mixed grip.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Step 2</strong>: Position your feet shoulder-width apart (or not much more) with toes under the bar.
                     Your feet point straight ahead, or they can angle out slightly.
                      Heels should stay flat on the surface. As you lift and lower the bar,
                       it will travel close to the shins and may even graze them. Maintain a neutral spine position.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Step 3</strong>: Engage your abdominal muscles.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Step 4</strong>: Slowly bring the weight down as far as you can while maintaining proper form,
                     softening your knees, and keeping your back flat.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Step 5</strong>: Lift the bar by pushing upward with the legs from the knees.
                     Breathe out on exertion. Be careful not to raise the hips first so the trunk moves forward and the back becomes rounded.
                      Donâ€™t try to haul the bar up with your arms. The arms stay extended under tension while gripping the bar as the legs push up.
                       Think of the legs and shoulders moving upward in unison with the hips, the balancing point.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Step 6</strong>: The bar should almost graze the shins and rest around the thighs as you reach full height.
                     Pull the shoulders back as much as possible without bending backward.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Step 7</strong>: Lower the bar toward the floor with a reverse motion ensuring a straight back.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <strong>Step 8</strong>: Repeat for your desired number of repetitions.
                </li>
            </ul>
